\title{Procrust analysis}
\usage{
procrust(X, Y)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{the target matrix}

\item{Y}{the matrix we want to fit to the target}
}
\value{
A list with the translation vector and the matrix of rotation
}
\description{
Do the procrust analysis X is the target matrix, Y is the matrix we want to fit to the target.
This procrust analysis give just a translation vector and a rotation matrix
After the procrust problem you \textbf{must} do the rotation before the translation.
\textbf{Warning :} The order of the between the lines of the matrix X and Y must be respected.
\textbf{The order of the value on both matrix is important}
